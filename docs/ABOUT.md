About YAMLscript
================

So you're ready to learn [YAMLScript](https://yamlscript.org)?!

Congratulations!

You are about to embark on a journey that will change the way you think about
data and programming.

Along the way you can expect to learn:

* A lot more about the [YAML](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) data language
  syntax
* A lion's share of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp) programming
  concepts
* How to get things done with [Functional Programming](
  https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and immutable data
  structures
* Enough of the [Clojure](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) programming
  language to be dangerous

YAMLscript is a new, functional, Open Source programming language with a YAML
based syntax that transpiles to Clojure code which is then evaluated by a
native binary runtime interpreter called `ys`.

YAMLScript is an excellent choice for solving Exercism exercises.
All of the exercises in this track have been solved in 3-50 comfortably spaced
lines of YAMLScript (10-15 on average).

It is a great language for learning functional programming and Lisp concepts,
while using a clean, friendly and fairly painless syntax inspired by the best
parts of YAML, Clojure, Perl, Python, JavaScript and CoffeeScript.


<!-- Keep this comment:

  This document contains a short introduction to the language.

  The introduction should be relatively brief and touch upon what
  makes the language interesting (and possibly unique). The goal
  is to help students decide if they want to join this track.

  The contents of this document are displayed on the track page,
  provided the student has not joined the track.
