Learning YAMLScript
===================

Here are some links to help you learn YAMLScript:

* Read the [YAMLScript Documentation](https://yamlscript.org/doc/)
* Look at some [YAMLScript Examples on Rosetta Code](
  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:YAMLScript#mw-pages)

YAMLScript is a relatively new programming language.
It is built over existing, robust technologies, but it still lacks all the
trimmings of a mature language.

Things like full user documentation, tutorials, syntax highlighting, tab
completion and a very long tail of other concerns are coming as soon as
possible.

YAMLScript is Open Source!

If your learning adventures lead to a desire to improve the language or the
tooling tech it needs to mature, don't hesitate to reach out and contribute!
