blurb:
  YAMLScript is a dynamic, general purpose programming language.
  It has a clean YAML syntax and embeds nicely into existing YAML files, making
  the desired parts of them dynamic.
  When a YAMLScript program is run, the source code transpiles to Clojure code,
  and is evaluted by a native binary runtime interpreter called `ys` (not by
  the JVM).
  YAMLScript is also available as a dynamic YAML loader library
