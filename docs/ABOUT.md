About YAMLscript
================

**[YAMLscript](https://yamlscript.org)** is a complete, Open Source programming
language and an excellent choice for solving **Exercism** exercises.
Its syntax is always valid **YAML**, but it is expressive as any modern
programming language.
All of the solutions to the exercises in this track have be done in less than 60
well spaced lines of YAMLScript, and most in less than 20.

When you run a YAMLScript program it actually transpiles dynamically to the
**Clojure** JVM/Lisp language.
Being a dialect of Clojure means that YAMLScript is a very full-featured
programming language, even though is is a relatively new one.

While being able to do almost anything that Clojure can do, it requires **No
Java or JVM** to be installed on your computer.
The YAMLScript interpreter `ys` is actually compiled to a native binary
executable.
It is as fast as typical dynamic languages like Python, and it has "batteries
included" to accomplish most common programming tasks with no external
dependencies.

> Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a
rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.

This means that YAMLScript is too!
It is a great language for learning functional programming and Lisp concepts,
while using a clean, friendly and fairly painless syntax inspired by the best
parts of YAML, Python, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript and CoffeeScript.
